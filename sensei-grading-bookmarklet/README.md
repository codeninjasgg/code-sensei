# `sensei-grading-bookmarklet`

## Usage

1. Visit the [grading console][grading_console] while logged in as a code sensei.
1. Paste the bookmarklet code in the [address bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar).
1. Make sure it is prefixed with `javascript:`.
1. Click <kbd>enter</kbd> to execute the bookmarklet code.

## Development

This [bookmarklet][bookmarklet_definition] is compiled using NodeJS.
To run in development mode, run `npm run dev`.

## Purpose

Grading code ninjas' submissions are slow and tedious because the current site has very poor UX.
My goal is to make an entirely keyboard-navigable enhancement in the form of a bookmarklet.
